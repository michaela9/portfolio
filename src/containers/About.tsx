              I found myself becoming increasingly unsatisfied and frustrated, so I chose to make a
              change.

              program, resulting in the new ReactGirls website, written in React and designed in
              Figma.

              In addition to regularly participating in meetups, this year I was a lecturer at React
              academy and I helped as a coach with the HTML, CSS and Javascipt Academy. I gave a
              lecture on the topic of &quot;Work on Travels&quot; at one of the meetups.

              For the past few years, I&apos;ve had the opportunity to pursue both my personal and
              professional aspirations. My partner and I had the privilege of almost one year of
              travelling with a van we renovated ourselves. During this time, I also worked
              part-time as a Frontend Developer.

              I&apos;ve worked on projects for Fitnut, Brainee academy and Onergetice.eu. Since
              January 2022, I&apos;ve been working for VS Point on larger projects using
              technologies such as React, Typescript, Tailwind and GraphQL.
