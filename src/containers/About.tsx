                In addition to regularly participating in meetups, this year I helped with the
                Javascript and React coaching of the autumn academy. At one of the meetups, I also
                gave a lecture on the topic of Work on travels.

                I soon started to fulfill my dreams, both professional and personal. For almost a
                year, my boyfriend and I traveled in a camper van that we rebuilt ourselves, and I
                worked part-time as a Frondend developer.

                I was working on projects fitnut.com, brainee.com and onergetice.eu during their
                redesign. Since January 2022, I have been working with the company VS point on
                larger project using technologies such as typescript, tailwind and graphql.

                Now, I would like to continue this fun, fast-paced journey as a front-end developer,
                become part of a pleasant team and learn a lot of new things.
